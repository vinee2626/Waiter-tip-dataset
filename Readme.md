# Waiter Tips Data-Set
This data set is in relation to the data tips received by a waiter from a male and female. Also further nuanced as the sex ratio and smoker or non smoker making tips to the waiter.  I have performed several exploratory analysis using pandas and seaborn.

I have used pandas, seaborn libraries in this project.

# Within the exploratory section, there are following question related to the data to perform exploratory analysis

- How many weekdays are present in the data set?
- How many dinner and lunches data are present in the data set?
- What is the proportion of dinner and lunch in %? 
- When does people pay more tip i.e during lunch or dinner?
- Avg tip for different 
    1. Smoker/ Non-Smoker
    2. Sex
    3. Day
    4. Size
- Minimum tip given by male and female smoker type
- Maximum tip fiven by male and female smoker type

# To answer these question I have used several pandas, seaborn and plotting methods. They include:

- Reading data from csv file to create a new DataFrame.
- Used seaborn methods and produced bar charts
- Used scatter graphs to describe the data in a concise way.
- Used groupby to perform aggregate analysis.
- Created pivot table
- Labelled all the graphs
